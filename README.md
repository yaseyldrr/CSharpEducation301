 ## **C# 301 Training Camp Projects**

This repository contains the projects I completed during the C# Training Camp 301 under the guidance of Murat YÃ¼cedaÄŸ.

ðŸŒŸ Projects:

ðŸš€ **Guide Operations Application**

   ```This project is a desktop application built using C#. It provides a simple interface to manage guides in a database. The application allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and query guide details efficiently.```

ðŸ”§**Key Learnings:**

**1. Using Entity Framework**

```Understanding ORM: Learning about Object Relational Mapping (ORM) tools and working with Entity Framework for database operations. Code-First Approach: Creating and managing database tables through C# classes. Database-First Approach: Integrating an existing database into the project and developing business logic. Migration Management: Managing schema changes in the database using EF Migrations. DbContext Usage: Managing database connections and configuring CRUD operations.```

**2. LINQ Queries**

```Data Querying: Fetching data from the database without writing SQL using LINQ. Filtering and Conditions: Using Where queries to fetch data based on conditions. Sorting: Ordering data in ascending or descending order (OrderBy, OrderByDescending). Grouping: Grouping data and performing specific operations on groups (GroupBy). Projection: Transforming or selecting data in different formats (Select). Aggregate Functions: Performing data analysis using functions like Sum, Count, Average, Min, and Max.```

**3. CRUD Operations**

```Create: Adding new records to the database using Entity Framework. Read: Fetching and displaying data from the database using LINQ queries. Update: Updating existing records based on user inputs. Delete: Safely deleting specific records from the database.```

**4. Windows Forms Application Development**

```UI Design: Using forms, buttons, textboxes, and listing controls to create user interfaces. Displaying Data with DataGridView: Showing query results in a tabular format. Event Handling: Handling events like button clicks to execute CRUD operations. Data Transfer Between Forms: Passing data from one form to another.```

**5. Performance Optimization**

```Learning methods to optimize performance in LINQ queries. Avoiding unnecessary data calls and fetching only required fields using projections (Select).```

**6. Debugging and Error Handling**

```Debugging database and business logic layers to fix errors. Resolving common issues with Entity Framework and LINQ, such as NullReferenceException or Lazy Loading problems.```

**7. Data Validation and Security**

```Data Validation: Ensuring valid and reliable data input before saving it to the database. Exception Handling: Managing errors during CRUD operations and showing appropriate error messages to the user.```

**8. Real-World Scenarios**

```Gaining insights into implementing a complete CRUD application. Experiencing the applicability of database operations in scenarios such as tour guides, locations, and statistics.```
